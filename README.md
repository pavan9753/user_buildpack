Heroku Buildpack for create-react-app
=====================================

After a long, useful run, this buildpack is now at its end of life ðŸŒ…

The underlying [static web server buildpack](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-static) is deprecated and will not be supported on Heroku-22 or newer stacks.

Please look into using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) or [Remix](https://remix.run) to develop React apps which are deployable using the [Node.js buildpack](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-nodejs).

----------

Original README is still available on the [final release tag](https://github.com/mars/create-react-app-buildpack/tree/v9.0.1).
